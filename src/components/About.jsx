      Public key cryptography is an essential technology to
      communicate secrets online, but
      can be confusing to understand and hard to use.
      It is like having a padlock with one key code
     to lock it and another secret key to unlock. That way, anyone
     can send you a secret by locking it, while only you get access.</p>
